rss2dl_bubba
============

Rss2dl adjusted to support torrent download on the bubba mini server from excito

Configuration should be placed in a file called<br>
conf_rss2dl.cnf

And the contents should be (this is my current):
<code>
<br>[rss2dl]
<br>passkey = XXX
<br>user = tobias
<br>timeLimitHours = 4
<br>verbose = 0
<br>episodeOnly = 1
</code>
